**MASTERING EXPRESSJS CRASh COURSE**

**Requirement / Prerequisites** </br>
1.JavaScript fundamentals (functions, loops, objects, classes etc) </br>
2. Asynchronous programming - Promise, callbacks, async/await.  </br>
3. HTTP Basics  (Methods, status codes, etc)  </br>

➡️ **EXPRESS.JS** </br>
✔️ What is Express.js ?  Express.js , is a Node.js framework, which has the following attributes / characteristic : It, </br>
1) Minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js </br>
2) Used for building “Server-Side Web Applications”, “Micro Services” and “APIs” . </br>
3)The most popular framework for Node. </br>
4) Simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses. </br>
5) Express is a very fast and unopinioated framework. </br>


➡️ **Opinionated Vs Unopinionated (Framework)**
✔️ Opinionated (Frameworks): </br>
1) Has a lot of rules  & conventions that you need to follow. </br>
2) Suggested ways to do things . </br>
3) Strict folder  structure. </br>
4) Suggested ways to do things . </br>
5) Strict folder  structure. </br>

✔️ Unopinionated (Frameworks): </br>
1) They  are extremely flexible (U can can structure apps how ever you want, & use what ever database, library you want). </br>
2) Different ways to do things . </br>
3) Includes the bare necessities. </br>
4) Structure folders how you want. </br>
5) Some Examples Include: Express.js , Flask, Spring . </br>

✔️ When Creating A Express.js Project: </br>
	**NOTE:** When starting a new “nodejs project”. </br>
The first 1st thing You will need to create a  “package.json” file . </br>
And we 	can do that by using an “NPM command on VSCode terminal (instead of creating it manuel)”, bellow is the following step : </br>
 npm init  </br>

The 2 Second 2nd  thing You do is to install “Express.js” & “save” it in your 	package.json 	dependencies, (in your project , use this command): </br> 
Npm install express --save </br>

The 3 Third 3rd   thing You do is to create the gitignore file in your Code Editor (e.g VSCode): </br>
.gitignore file, allows developers to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control (Git). This helps keep repositories tidy, preventing sensitive information from being exposed , and ensures that only essential files are tracked.   A diagram below: </br>

The 4 Fouth 4th  thing” you will need to do is, “creating an entry file”. (which is your main file). E.g like index.js  , app.js. , server.js  (diagram below): </br>

➡️ **ROUTING (In Express.js) -  LESSON 1** </br>
NOTE: When developing with Express.js,  the package manager you would use to install a tool that automatically restarts your server upon code changes includes: 
 npm (Node Package Manager) 3rd parrty package Or the watch flask (node watch) </br>
